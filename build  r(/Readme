## Build
To build our robot, we used the LEGO Robot Inventor kit along with some additional elements. The list of materials is detailed below:

## LEGO Robot Inventor Kit:
Programmable Hub
Robot Inventor Motors (Large Motors)
Sensors (not used in this project)
Standard LEGO Wheels
LEGO Structural Parts
LEGO Axles and Connectors
Rechargeable Robot Inventor Battery
Connection Cables
Additional Items:
Additional LEGO parts for structural reinforcement (if necessary)
Basic construction tools (optional, to facilitate assembly)
Chassis Type & Explanation
Our robot is a four-wheeled vehicle with rear-wheel drive and steering in the front. We decided to implement a simple chassis to reduce complexity and, therefore, the chances of failure. To keep the drivetrain simple and efficient, we ensured that the steering mechanism is not on the same set of wheels as the driving wheels. This solves the issue of space, as the steering motor and the drive motors do not have to be on the same set of wheels. Our decision led us to two driving options: front-wheel drive with rear steering or rear-wheel drive with front steering. We ultimately chose a rear-wheel drive with front steering, as it felt more familiar based on our experience with other rear-wheel-driven LEGO robots.

## Steering
Management System
Principle of Differential Steering
We use the principle of differential steering to control the movement of the robot. This system does not require a separate steering mechanism but adjusts the speed of each motor to turn.

## Operation
Straight motion: To move the robot in a straight line, both motors rotate at the same speed.
Left turn: To turn left, the right motor rotates faster than the left motor.
Right turn: To turn right, the left motor rotates faster than the right motor.
Movement
## Movement Calculation
Without the use of sensors, we rely on accurate calculations to control the robot's movement. We use the rotation degrees of the motors to determine the distance traveled and the time required for each movement.

## Distance Formula
Distance
=
Wheel Circumference
×
Motor Revolutions
Distance=Wheel Circumference×Motor Revolutions

## Materials
Construction Steps
Hub Installation: We place the programmable Robot Inventor hub in the center of the structure to maintain proper balance.
Motor Installation: We use two large Robot Inventor motors, one for each rear wheel. This provides us with the power needed to move the robot and the ability to control each wheel separately for steering.
Wheel Fixation: We place standard LEGO wheels on the axles connected to the motors. The front wheels are fixed to provide stability.
Chassis Structure: We use LEGO structural parts to create a robust chassis that supports the weight of the programmable hub and the motors. We ensure that the chassis has enough space for the installation of the battery and the necessary wiring.
Cables and Connections: We connect the motors to the programmable hub using the cables provided in the kit. We ensure the cables are properly secured and organized to avoid tangling.
This version is specifically adapted for the LEGO Robot Inventor kit, reflecting the features and components available in this kit.
